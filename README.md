# Assignment_2

Student Name: Peter McAlister
Student Number: s394034
The four main objectives of this project are
1.	Create a Linux kernel for the Raspberry Pi
2.	Run Phoronix test suite for four suites
3.	Provide the results for the test suites
4.	Ensure correct instructions are provided and that man pages are created and commenting
Linux Kernel
To achieve this, I followed the instructions as per the raspberry pi instructions at the link below
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md
The two conditions were to change the local version to append your student number and disable the camera function
Phoronix / Report
I followed the instructions as per week 8 and at the link below, changed the sources library and installed the test suite. I then ran four of the test suites and provided the results in my GIT repository. I also made a report in HTML and uploaded that to the repository
Man Pages
As per the convention I created one ‘man’ page with the instructions for the script in the correct format.
I used shell check to correct my script
