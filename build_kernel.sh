:'checkout your repository (must be done using ssh not https and 
must be done with ssh keys from your end so no password will be 
required. Do not submit any kind of password or ssh key as in that 
case you will get no marks for this part of the assignment. So long 
as you have made rmitusap a collaborator and you have setup 
the keys correctly on your raspberry pi this is all that will be required.'
