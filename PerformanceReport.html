		<h1>Performance Report Raspberry Pi</h1>
		<h2>St<h2>Student Number: s3294034</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this report is to details findings from the running o I choose this tests is because they test the performance of the raspberry pi in terms of performance</p>
			<p>against a real world situation, the raspberry pi can be used for crypto mining and as such the cpu and networking</p>
			<p>cabability would be in question, I choose chess as a comparison as almost all computers have Chess as a game onystem</p><br>
			<h3>METHOD</h3>
			<p>I initially scrolled through the test suites and tests to see what was avaliable, I have tested many sofwtare applications but never performed</p>
			<p>peformance testing whetehr jmeter or neoload so this is as close as I will get. Havign read an article about Pi's being used for crytpo I thought</p>
			<p>what would be the parameters for the application that would need to be tested, this is why I decided on the above listed 4 stest suites </p><br>
			<p>Installation: The steps used are as follows<p>
			<p>1. sudo apt-get update of the pi to ensure that any necessary dependacies are in place</p>
			<p>2. Alter the mirrors to those in the documentation (see below)</p>
			<p>3. change directory tot he appropriate file</p>
			<p> command: /etc/apt/sources.list</p>
			<p>deb http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/raspbian/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi</p>
			<p>deb http://mbionic main restricted multiverse universe</p>
			<p>4. Save the file</p>
			<p>5. Next required the changing of the keys within the system - see below commands</p>
			<p> command: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32</p>
			<p> command: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 871920D1991BC93C</p>
			<p>6.next install the test suites</p>
			<p> command: sudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite</p><br>
			<p>Using Phoronix</p>
			<p>Once installed I then went to the Raspberry Pi interface and ran th as listed above</p><br>
