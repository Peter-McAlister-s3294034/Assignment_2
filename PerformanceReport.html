		<h1>Performance Report Raspberry Pi</h1>
		<h2>Student Name: Peter McAlister</h2>
		<h2>Student Number: s3294034</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this report is to details findings from the running of the following four test suites</p>
			<p>005 Chess</p>
			<p>011 CPU</p>
			<p>014 Cryptography</p>
			<p>079 Network</p>
			<p>The reason I choose these tests is because they test the performance of the raspberry pi in terms of performance</p>
			<p>against a real-world situation, the raspberry pi can be used for crypto mining and as such the CPU and networking</p>
			<p>capability would be in question; I choose chess as a comparison as almost all computers have Chess as a game on their system</p>
			<p>Here is a link to the article</p>
			<p>h-to/mine-cryptocurrency-raspberry-pi</p>
			<br>
			<h3>METHOD</h3>
			<p>I initially scrolled through the test suites and tests to see what was avaliable, I have tested many software applications but never performed</p>
			<p>performance testing whether JMeter or neoload so this is as close as I will get. Having read an article about Pi's being used for crypto I thought</p>
			<p>what would be the parameters for the application that would need to be tested, this is why I decided on the above listed 4 test suites </p><br>
			<p>Installation: The steps used are as follows<p>
			<p>1. sudo apt-get update of the pi to ensure that any necessary dependencies are in place</p>
			<p>2. Alter the mirrors to those in the documentation (see below)</p>
			<p>3. change directory to the appropriate file</p>
			<p> command: /etc/apt/sources. List</p>
			<p>deb http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/raspbian/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi</p>
			<p>deb http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/ubuntu-ports bionic main restricted multiverse universe</p>
			<p>4. Save the file</p>
			<p>5. Next required the changing of the keys within the system - see below commands</p>
			<p> command: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32</p>
			<p> command: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 871920D1991BC93C</p>
			<p>6.next install the test suites</p>
			<p> command: sudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite</p><br>
			<p>Using Phoronix</p>
			<p>Once installed I then went to the Raspberry Pi interface and ran the tests</p>
			<p>1. Select Command Menu - System Tools - phoronix test suite</p>
			<p>2. Command terminal is displayed</p>
			<p>3. Select 2 "Run a Suite"</p>
			<p>4. Select the appropriate tests as listed above</p>
			<br>

			<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
			<p>Simple put the results do not look favourable for the Raspberry Pi as a crypto mining device.</p>
			<p>They are high when they should be low and low when high, it is by its nature a lite computer</p>
			<p>so it is puzzling why someone would want to use it for this, I can understand that they can tweak</p>
			<p>the Pi but the results for CPU, Network and Crypto do not look good. After having read the article</p>
			<p> and studied the results I cannot see that it is feasible beyond a simple curiosity</p>
			<br>
			<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
			<p>I would not think that this is a proper device to be used for crypto currency mining</p>
			<p>The more people who get involved the harder it is to mine and the more likelihood of the Pi failing</p>
			<p>Even when grouping together you still run the risk of the large crypto miners in China</p>
			<p>out stripping you and so you lose out</p>
			<br>
			<p>I would recommend against it as a way of making money but maybe as a simple hobby</p>
